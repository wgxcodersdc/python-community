There are some workarounds for javascript-heavy pages:

1. Try to find the urls that the javascript calls use (eg, api.your.site)
2. Use selenium or splash to help render javascript

*** Note: This example requires Splash ***

We are not installing Splash as part of this lab. This one is just to demo,
and it requires docker and splash:

    docker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash

But you if you want to later, you can go to:
