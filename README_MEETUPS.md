## WGXCDC_PYTHON

### Hiya! Welcome to our Github repo. In here you will find WGXC DC DC Python Chapter Powerpoints and Materials from past Meetups.

#### If you are a beginner, please look out for our meetups [here](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/) , we host them every other First Wednesday of the Month!

**Instructions to download Python for your first time**

*Windows Users*

 I would recommend downloading via the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). Download Python 3.7 since Python 2.7 will be retiring in a few months! In here you will find other added bonuses :
 
 + IDEs to write code like Spyder or Jupyter Notebook
 + Python preinstalled packages for data science such as Pandas for tabular data analysis, Matplotlib for Data Visualizations, Numpy for mathematical data crunching, and more!
 + R, another open source language for statistics 
 
 *Mac Users*
 
 Congrats You already have python installed! However as mentioned before Python 2 will be retiring so you will have to upgrade to Python 3. This is the best article I have come across for keeping environment seperates for Python 2 and 3 for mac users, click [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx).
 
 ### If you are not a beginner, keep an eye out for our meetups on the same link above, we host advanced Python topics every 3rd wendesday of the month. We mostly host our meetups in DC but sometimes we will host in Northern Virginia and southern Maryland.
 
 Topics we have hosted in the past consist of :
 
 + Elastic Search
 + Webscraping with BeautifulSoup4 or Scrapy
 + Pandas
 + Matplotlib
 + Conditionals
 + Object Oriented Programming
 + APIs
