# Python study group!
*This repo is preserved in case this subgroup is revived - Aug 2025*

## Participating

### Empowering Women and Non-binary Voices
Women and Gender eXpansive Coders DC events are primarily intended to create an empowering and supportive space for women and non-binary individuals to find community, learn new technical concepts, and expand their coding and technical skills. We welcome allies, but we ask that they remain mindful of the eventsâ€™ focus in creating an inclusive environment where women and non-binary participants can connect and fully express themselves.

### What is this study group for?

The WGXC Python study group is a space where women can come together and help each other learn and understand software development with Python development. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There's always at least one mentor/leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem!

All study groups are scheduled via our [Meetup](women-and-gender-expansive-coders-dc-wgxc-dc/) page. We meet every Thursday 06:30-08:30 pm. Every study group will have the following format:

* 6:15 - 6:40pm - Networking and getting to know each other
* 6:40 - 6:50pm - Quick Introductions
* 6:50 - 8:00pm - CODE!
* 8:00 - 8:15pm - Lightning Talk (a quick presentation or talk) (if planned)
* 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up

### What if I'm a first timer who's never coded before?

Check out our guide to [python for first-timers](first_timers_guide.md). It has information to get you set up with Python and resources for getting started with coding. Go through the recommended resources and ask lots of questions!

### What if I know how to program, but I'm new to Python?

Check out our [python for programmers](python_for_programmers.md) guide, which has resources for getting you up to speed on Python without subjecting you to yet another explanation of what a for-loop is.

### What if I'm a python development pro?

We super encourage you to attend the study group, work on a personal project or take one of the recommended courses to further your skills, help others with questions they might have, consider doing a lighting talk, consider being a lead!

## Contributing

### What do leads do?

Leads are present to facilitate the study group. They help find hosts, schedule meetups, come up with curriculum, and are also available to ask questions.

### Can I be a lead?

YES! We are always looking for more leads and if you're interested in getting involved in WGXC DC in any capacity talk to one of the leads present!

### How can I contribute without being a lead?

There are lots of ways to contribute! We especially need help coordinating events. If you want to help out please let us know :)

## Community

### Slack

The WGXC DC community uses Slack to keep in touch, share resources, and chat about all things tech. You can use Slack to ask troubleshooting questions or general questions about coding (in any language) and the tech industry. We encourge you to [sign up here](https://forms.gle/p6KYBpxSMoq3CvQU8) and [read our Slack guide if you need more help.](http://bit.ly/slackguide)

## Logistics

### Building Access

Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you.

Happy coding! :)
